🌌 Strategic Storytelling & Digital Strategy for Astronomy Outreach Centres
Strategic proposal for positioning, community building, and data-informed communication
by Begoña Penón
[This portfolio was initially developed as part of a public-sector application. It has since been adapted for open use and science outreach purposes.]
---
🌠 Introduction
This portfolio is not just a collection of past projects — it’s a call to action.
A vision for how passion for the cosmos can spark community, cultivate shared knowledge, and create unforgettable public experiences.
Each section reflects applied strategies for positive engagement, real-world examples of community-building success, and a practical roadmap for what science communication can achieve when it caters to human curiosity.
It is also a professional orbit I want to keep charting: where digital creativity meets purpose, and astronomy connects people not only to the stars, but to each other.

- Positive gamification: Friendly competitions and giveaways to build collective excitement
- Community narratives: Every step became part of a larger shared story
The Outcome
- A self-sustaining community that connected beyond the event
- A celebratory atmosphere that transcended digital boundaries
- Returning participants who brought new faces year after year
- Recognition as a benchmark in meaningful engagement
Relevance for Astronomy Outreach Centres
This same energy can fuel the 2026 Eclipse initiative — building an international community of sky-watchers who feel part of something truly memorable.

Epilogue — Communicating the Cosmos Is Inspiring Futures
Every girl who peers through a telescope at the Outreach Centre might become the astrophysicist who discovers distant exoplanets.
Every woman who joins a stargazing night could turn into a lifelong ambassador of scientific knowledge.
Every female student who grasps the scale of the universe may find the courage and curiosity to pursue a future in STEM and help shape the world through science.
My purpose at the Research Centre is clear:
To turn every astronomical discovery into a seed of inspiration.
Every data point into a memorable story.
Every visitor — especially every girl with wonder in her eyes — into a Cosmic Ambassador.

Astronomy is not only a science. It is a gateway to awe. A bridge between people and the vastness we share.
This portfolio was never intended to impress; it was meant to invite. Science must be explored, but it must also be explained. That is the path I choose to follow.
